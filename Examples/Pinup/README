RUNNING THE EXAMPLE:
To run this example first install the pvmos-mesh package.
After that run generate_mesh.m within octave, e.g. within octave
run "source generate_mesh.m". Alternatively you can execute from 
the commandline:
octave generate_mesh
This should result in a PVMOS mesh in the file "pinupmesh.bin".
After this you can execute pvmos with the pinup.mos input file.
