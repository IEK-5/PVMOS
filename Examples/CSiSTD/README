PVMOS input file for a c-Si:H cell with three busbars
In this example I show how you can script a mesh together
In general the method a shown in the Pinup example is much simpler to do. However, if you
know what you are doing this method has the advantage of being fast and does not require any 
other tool than PVMOS. The downside is that it is tedious and offers oppurtunities to shoot 
yourself in the foot.

In PVMOS you have several tools to "script" a mesh, i.e. define a mesh by a sequence of 
commands. I refer to the manual for a reference of the available commands to do this. In
this example I will show how one can define a crystalline silicon solar cell with a typical 
grid and three busbars. Here is a schemetic ASCII-art of the cell design:

                             20.08333..      61.75          103.4166..
                                 -             -                -
                             21.58333..      63.25          104.9166..



Thus we have three busbars which are 1.5 mm wide. There are 63 horizontal fingers of 200µm wide.
The fingers have a spacing of 1.98387 mm. The fingers are 123mm long (i.e. there is a 1mm edge
around the cell without fingers). There are two vertical fingers at the left and right side.

If you define a regular mesh for the cell you will find you have to fit many geomeric details in 
the mesh. For example the positions of the busbars, the positions of the fingers, the width of the 
fingers the width of the busbars, etc. If you want to use a regular mesh for that you will 
probably end up with a quite high number of elements, or, a mesh where for example the busbar width 
is not accurate. 

In this example we avoid that by not defining one regular mesh but defining many regular meshes 
which we glue together. This way I can define a variable mesh which fits in all geometric details 
with much less elements as compared to a regular mesh.

I will built up my cell in several steps:
- I first create a horizontal section of the cell which includes one horizontal finger and the 
  height spans exactly the finger spacing (The busbars are not yet defined in this mesh but a 
  space is built in which is exactly the width of the busbars so it can be accurately defined 
  later).
- The mesh defined above is stacked 62 times to get 62 horizontal fingers.
- Create the busbars
- Add meshes at the top and bottom to contact the cell
  
All these steps are taken in the PVMOS input file "CSiSTD.mos".
