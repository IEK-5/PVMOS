Thin Film solar module examples.

There are two examples here. One 8x8 cm2 a-Si:H mini-module
with a local defect and one 40x40 cm2 a-Si:H module with a 
random distribution of defects. 

Requirements:
- The 8x8 cm2 example only needs a working PVMOS.
- The 40x40 cm2 example needs PVMOS and GNU Octave. In this
  example we will first use PVMOS to generate a 40x40 module 
  without defects (using thin_film40x40.mos). The mesh for
  the defect free module is then saved to a file. The GNU
  Octave script Shunts40x40.m is then used to generate a 
  random distribution of defects. The script will 
  automatically generate scripts for PVMOS which will use 
  the saved mesh for a defect-free module and add defects.
