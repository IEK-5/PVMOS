PVMOS Installation:

COMPILING:
PVMOS depends the CHOLMOD library which is part of suitesparse (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/).
To install PVMOS you should thus first install suitesparse. Once suitesparse is available you can compile PVMOS by
typing make.

For the best performance you also need an optimized BLAS. I used openblas (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/). To 
link to the optimized BLAS you may need to explicitely reference the optimized version in the LFLAGS variable in the 
makefile. For example to link PVMOS to openblas in my system I compile with 
LFLAGS=-lcholmod -lopenblas -lm
