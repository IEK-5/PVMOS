\@doendnote{endnote3}{Many BLAS versisons seem to suffer from a bug which makes that \protect \texttt  {cholmod} performance deteriorates when multi-threading is enabled \cite {Davis:2007:Online}. If your BLAS library has multi-threading enabled, performance may improve if you set environment variables such that BLAS will use only one thread. In case of \protect \texttt  {OpenBLAS} with OpenMP you need to set \protect \texttt  {OMP\protect \_NUM\protect \_THREADS=1}, e.g. \protect \texttt  {export OMP\protect \_NUM\protect \_THREADS=1} in bash or \protect \texttt  {SET OMP\protect \_NUM\protect \_THREADS=1} in DOS}
